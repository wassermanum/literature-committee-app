# Task 10: Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive notification system for the Literature Committee application that handles email and internal notifications for various events including order creation, status changes, low inventory alerts, and order reminders.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Core Services

#### NotificationService (`src/services/notificationService.ts`)
- **Main notification orchestrator** that handles sending notifications via different channels
- **Email notifications** using nodemailer with HTML and text templates
- **Internal notifications** (logged for now, can be extended to database storage)
- **Order-related notifications**: creation and status change alerts
- **Inventory notifications**: low stock alerts with configurable thresholds
- **Reminder system**: automated reminders for old orders
- **Multi-channel support**: EMAIL, INTERNAL, or BOTH
- **Error handling**: graceful failure handling without breaking main operations

#### NotificationTemplateService (`src/services/notificationTemplateService.ts`)
- **Template generation** for different notification types
- **Multilingual support** (Russian language templates)
- **HTML and text versions** for all email templates
- **Dynamic content** with order details, inventory info, and reminder data
- **Professional styling** with responsive HTML templates
- **Status-specific formatting** with color coding and icons

#### ScheduledNotificationService (`src/services/scheduledNotificationService.ts`)
- **Automated scheduling** for periodic notification checks
- **Order reminders**: every 6 hours for orders older than 3 days
- **Low inventory checks**: every 12 hours with configurable threshold
- **Manual triggers** for testing and admin operations
- **Graceful startup/shutdown** with proper cleanup
- **Status monitoring** for scheduled jobs

### 2. Configuration and Types

#### Email Configuration (`src/config/email.ts`)
- **SMTP transporter setup** with nodemailer
- **Environment-based configuration** for different deployment environments
- **Connection verification** with error logging
- **Default email settings** (from, reply-to addresses)
- **Template configuration** (base URLs, logos, support contacts)

#### Notification Types (`src/types/notification.ts`)
- **Comprehensive type definitions** for all notification components
- **Enums for notification types**: ORDER_CREATED, ORDER_STATUS_CHANGED, LOW_INVENTORY, ORDER_REMINDER, SYSTEM_ALERT
- **Channel types**: EMAIL, INTERNAL, BOTH
- **Priority levels**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
- **Data structures** for different notification scenarios
- **Template data interfaces** for type-safe template generation

### 3. API Routes

#### Notification Routes (`src/routes/notifications.ts`)
- **Manual notification triggers** for testing and admin use
- **Order notification endpoints**: creation and status change
- **Inventory notification endpoints**: low stock alerts
- **Scheduled service management**: manual triggers and status checks
- **Development test endpoint** for email testing
- **Authentication middleware** integration
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper HTTP status codes

### 4. Integration Points

#### Order Service Integration
- **Automatic notifications** on order creation
- **Status change notifications** when order status updates
- **Non-blocking implementation** - notifications don't affect order operations
- **Error logging** without interrupting business logic

#### Inventory Service Integration
- **Low stock monitoring** with configurable thresholds
- **Automatic alerts** when inventory drops below threshold

- **Template service testing** for all notification types
- **Email sending simulation** with success/failure scenarios
- **Database interaction mocking** for order and inventory operations
- **Error handling verification** for various failure modes

#### Integration Tests (`src/__tests__/notificationRoutes.test.ts`)
- **API endpoint testing** for all notification routes
- **Authentication middleware testing** 
- **Request/response validation** for different scenarios
- **Error response testing** for invalid inputs
- **Development endpoint testing** for email functionality

#### Scheduled Service Tests (`src/__tests__/scheduledNotificationService.test.ts`)
- **Timer-based testing** with Jest fake timers
- **Manual trigger testing** for admin operations

### 6. Utilities and Helpers

#### Logger Utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
- **Winston-based logging** with multiple transports
- **Environment-specific configuration** (console in dev, files in prod)
